	<section id="what">
		<h1> What is pair programming? </h1>
		<p> Pair programing is when two or more people collaborate in code. 
		It is a great way of sharing authorship of code creation. With two people collaborating on the same document in real time whether virtually or one-on-one in person this allows for give-and-take tag team approach to solving and playing in the name of improving on the task at hand.  This allows for using communication and mutual understanding within the context code.

	<section id="why">
		<h1> Why is pair programming important to DBC? </h1>
		<p> It's a common a programming practice that encourages efficiency in learning and improving code. This practice also strengthens communication and technical skills among coders. 
		Although increasingly popular in software development program is particularly important to DBC because at its core it enhances the learning experience new knowledge is being shared in the solidified between the pier the. Programmers in their able to learn and review and reflect like teaching their Coalport or pair this gives an opportunity for both members of the pair to share and we consider differences and learn constructive criticism on the four concepts of feedback and compromise.

	<section id="compare">
		<h1> Compare driver and navigator. </h1>
		<p> While the driver writes the actual code the navigator steers through the and provides directions towards the task completion. When embracing the driver navigator analogy one assumes that only one person can drive to the go to the destination that leaves the other in charge of general direction and navigation and over all responsibility for looking ahead and being mindful of present positioning. Giving directions to the  the driver who makes sure to cover the road or code in this case.</p>
		<p> 
		These roles are not black-and-white so they can be shared throughout the meeting to programming session also they can switch seats to give that a coverage issue and to share  roles and responsibilities.</p>

	<section id="reflect">
		<h1>Reflection</h1>
		<p>
		This was myfirst time and was a little bit nerve-racking and awkward to learn the different interface windows, different screenshares and links. But it was very helpful to be able to connect to someone and share the pros and cons of recent experiences, new learning points and be able to discuss how we are going to work together and then actually complete the task together. I did enjoy it.
		Constant communication is what worked and being able to switch back-and-forth  between the dual roles of the driver navigator constantly checking in with your pair asking for feedback and sharing the responsibility in a balanced way. What didn't work was using stypi  in this context wasn't necessary to write code simultaneously we ended up just emailing our changes and then  combining them on local machines for github prep.
