  <div class="reflection">
    Reflection for unit one week to challenge five design I had to responsify with my pair .I really enjoyed researching and completing the project there's a lot of good resources out there and in the module. So the chrome tool devform of mobile simulation was very helpful in getting responses and feedback on the responsive website , one of the key concepts that was solidified was using percentages and the  formula for percentages that was described as element / target helps to make everything that was in pixels convert into percentages. <br>Media queries tutorial was key in solidifying my knowledge assisted me to realize that putting rules inside of the assigned media sizes and listing them was very helpful in understanding CSS better and also the way that different media screens respond learning how to put the meta-tag in the HTML to reset the viewport was also very helpful, solidifying the idea of reset or resizing things to its native display to further solidify learning along the path of cleaning the slate so you can design clean code for efficient and aesthetic multi-media projects.
