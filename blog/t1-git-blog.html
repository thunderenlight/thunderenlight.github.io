      So what exactly is version control? It is an algorithm driven software developing tool. Born from the need to Track Changes, It allows teams and individuals access and add to exsisting projects in a progress monitored enviroment. 
      It gives you power and control over different versions and different iterations of versions without having to try and keep track and save copies and try to remember where they are and what they had in them this allows incremental data storage and organization.

      Github  gives you an online account system that allows you access everywhere. Allowing  others access as in open sourcing and feedback.
      Developers use version control to test quality of code to incrementally fix improve work on bugs in a very controlled constructive collaborative environment.

    <p>
        Git allows developers to collaborate on different areas of projects without
        interfering with others work or progress overall. It takes the most efficient routes to monitor changes and merges while eliminating conflicts.

         "Git makes  remote repository sort of a central clearing house for all of these different changes that are going on, and that remote server is just simply a Git repository. Remember that Git is distributed version control. There's no real difference between the different repositories, so there's not a big difference between the server and our computer or the client. The only difference really is that the server is running some Git software that allows it to communicate with lots of different Git clients at the same time, but the actual repository where those changes are being stored, is just simply a Git repository; it has commits, it has branches, it has a HEAD pointer. It works exactly the same, and the fact that that Git repository is the central clearing house is really just a matter of convention."
