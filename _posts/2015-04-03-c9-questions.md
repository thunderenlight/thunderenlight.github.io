### Asking Good Questions


It's very important test questions specially the ones that you think are down and make you look stupid intention to ask those questions and to predicate my success on my ability to open myself up and asked for help and always be getting help and always be making room for of advice and help and tips and all different places especially human resources that I have on site. I plan to intentionally start off with in the right foot by asking for help for things that I don't even know I need help for help concerning a plan and I will and I pledge to ask as many questions and be the squeaky wheel and I plan to not be shy and withdraw when confused when stumbling when those knees are scuffed head is dizzy and heart is heavy with the lack this lab is one of self discovery and self occupation and I will reach out and question everything and accept my condition and capacity whilst being open thinker and actor in my evolution.
