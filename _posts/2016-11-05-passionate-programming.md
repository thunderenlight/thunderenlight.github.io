I'm obsessed with web technologies and open source.  With a passionate concentration on software engineering because it is developing new ways to empower those on the other side of the digital divide. Reaching beyond my comfort zone, I have come to love learning code mostly through the idea and implementation of open source and constant data feedback. Approaching the engineering community has given me opportunities to learn with peers from different backgrounds,  from instructors that lead with their heart and this has been the greatest motivation and structure for growth.


Although I am currently a member of several women in code organizations and a volunteer with chicktech.org.  I believe that having a engineering role and growing in a company is a very powerful tool and example to reach and encourage other women. So many of us in the tech community are not exposed to the experience of women in engineering leadership roles and this lack of diversity helps no one. I plan to share my knowledge and perspective even in the classroom, and more pointedly in code creation providing accessibility and visibility should narrow the gap!
