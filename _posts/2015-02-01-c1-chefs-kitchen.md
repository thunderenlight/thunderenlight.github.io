 After watching the [video]("http://vimeo.com/85001014 "Firechat Video") I did have nightmares, with coldsweats included. I feel it is going to be just that: wholistic Boot Camp for my mind and for my heart (porbably my back will feel it even more). I think I see myself engaging in a second nature way and kind of going back-and-forth between the kitchen mentality in the table mentality hopefully I can remember to be more proactive and stay in the kitchen and remain less transactional. Sadly, it is an easy trap to fall into specially in a stressful situation and being amongst strangers whose expectations of  DEVC may or may not have changed. I feel like it's going to be even harder than I can imagine and I'm completely unnerved.I wonder if it's more of a psychological experiment and if I can hold strong under it and if I can take it in stride as a learning experience and journey not so much about ruby but about myself.

		I get the sense that just like a Boot Camp for soldiers this is actually like preparation for career war or that it is kind of a war within psychologically and mentally and of course with preconceived notions. So hopefully training for real world battles challenges andcompany interviews at least the jobseeking process in general >The Video I love also as it addtesses work and pairing and true feedback muliplied by the idea of sharing the burden of those solve the challenges and also solidifying the individuals knowledge so they may combine  efforts and energies. Yeah I watch alot of cartoons andanime . This video leaves me hoping I have a hidden super power. It also reminds me to reach out and be open about my lack of knowledge and how it can concern and help and not just hinders.
