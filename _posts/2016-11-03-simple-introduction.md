As a highly adaptable non-chameleon with a common sense kind of of humor, high degree of ownership, and overall passion for technology and troubleshooting.

As your Web Developer ready to immerse myself into the team for whatever is asked of me. This is not a just an opportunity to  deal with current issues, but help create and architect a vision of what an optimal system would look like in the future.

I'm obsessed with data technologies, hardware and open source. With a passionate concentration on software engineering because it is developing new ways to empower those on the other side of the digital divide. Reaching beyond my comfort zone, I have come to love learning code mostly through the idea and implementation of open source and constant data feedback. Approaching the engineering community has given me opportunities to learn with peers from different backgrounds, from coworkers that lead with their heart and this has been the greatest motivation and structure for growth.
