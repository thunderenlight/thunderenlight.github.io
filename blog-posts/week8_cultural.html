			<h3>Compass Of Shame</h3>

		<p>
		Reasons to get into conflict and sources of conflict can be found anywhere and everywhere within ourselves and I daily lives and just basic functioning and in the simplest tasks . Many of these conflicts are exasperated by for communication and resources they can be highlighted also buy different styles and values they can grow in environment where perceptions goals pressures and expectations are wildly different.</p>Reminds me of recent time in my life where had an ongoing conflict which my my strategies and actions made it worse in my example I had an issue with my car and they took it to a mechanic and the mechanic said you needed to troubleshoot the car and took the car and never brought it back my temps to reach out to him failed and then I will and then I was in a situation where didn't know if my car was stolen or towed ot totaled!</p>

		Unfortunately as is my style often I go into avoidance mode and I added on the compass and I chose to just trying call and wait for an update.  Come to find out the mechanic in testing the car was in a serious accident and he also chose to go until voidance moved so there was a long period of time where he avoided my calls and I'm voided, fronting him in person I'll calling the police so that was a great good to her three weeks ago I had no idea where my car was. 
		And my real world example things became a lot worse because both parties or systematically avoiding confrontation although I was not hiding in the other party was I still feel part responsible for not confronting issue head on... <br>
		
		Hopefully in this instance I learned being assertive and not circumventing the confrontation can be because once the confrontation happened it was extremely charged and emotional so this was really about poorly handled conflict if I could go back and make it and do it differently I would've been less avoiding more confronting	and definitely would've been more aware of my own feelings and taking care of my own side of the conflict instead of worrying about the other parties feelings possible anger or dismissal of me if I go back I would absolutely stand up for myself called the police and filed a police report even have gone to court just so that the conflict would be resolved soon in my situation it went on for months unnecessarily because my irrational fear of confrontation.
