			<h4> RUBY ARRAYS - Why are they so awesome?</h4>

		<p>Let's Hash it out!</p>
		</div>
		<p>A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. Also called associative arrays, they are similar to Arrays, but where an Array uses integers as its index, a Hash allows you to use any object type. Hashes enumerate their values in the order that the corresponding keys were inserted. A Hash can be easily created by using its implicit form:</p>

		<p> Hashes are an unordered, object- indexed collection of objects. So notice, first of all, that where an array is an ordered collection, a hash is an unordered collection. That's a very important difference. We cannot count on the order that things are going to be stored in a hash. And instead of being indexed by their position and keeping track of the number, instead we are going to keep track of them using an object.

		We call this a key-value pair. We have one object that's the key and it references a second object that's a value. If you think about a expanding file folder metaphor thashes work a little bit more like hanging file folders. They are not in any certain order. They can be rearranged. Each of those file folders is going to have a label on it, and that's how we are going to find information. Since we can't know what order it's in anymore, now we are going to just thumb through those file folders in our hanging file folder until we find the label that corresponds to what we are looking for.
		So instead of saying well, our phone bill is in pocket one and our electric bill is in pocket two, instead we will say find the thing labeled phone bill and pull out its contents. Its contents will be the value. So that's a key-value pair. So both an array and a hash have a very good purpose. When we want to preserve the order and the order matters to us, we want to use an array.</p>

		<h4>Advantages</h4>

    	<p>Hashes have a default value. This value is returned when an attempt is made to access keys that do not exist in the hash. By default this value is nil. The Hash class has many methods and you can refer them here.

		There may be times when you must access each variable in the hash. You can still loop over the variables in the hash using the each loop, though it won't work the same way as using the each loop with array variables. Remember that since a hash is unordered, the order in which "each" will loop over the key/value pairs may not be the same as the order in which you inserted them. In this example, a hash of grades will be looped over and printed.

		Like all high-level languages, Ruby has built-in support for arrays, objects that contain ordered lists of other objects. Each element is a reference to some object The object references can be  predefined variables  anonymous objects created on the spot. You can use arrays (often in conjunction with hashes) to build and use complex data structures without having to define any custom classes. Hash is a collection data structure consisting of key-value pairs. Key and value can be any object

		We could have a mixed objects in arrays. The same thing is true for the keys and the values that are inside a hash. We could have the number 1 that points to a, b, c and then a comma and our next one, which will be 'hello', which is a string that's going to point to 'world'.
