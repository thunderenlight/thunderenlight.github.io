			<h4> REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</h4>

			A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular expressions as wildcards on steroids. You are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as *.txt to find all text files in a file manager. The regex equivalent is <code>.*\.txt$</code>.

			</p>

			<p>Regular Expressions or RegEx first got their start in the field of neuroscience, way back in the 1940s. In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts developed models describing how the human nervous system works, or how a machine or a computer could be built to act more like a human brain. In 1956, Stephen Kleene described these models with an algebra that he called regular sets, and he created a notation to express them called regular expressions.That's where we get the name from; Stephen Kleene is the one who coined it. But at this point, regular expressions have still not entered the computer world; they are not part of the digital age yet. It's not until 1968 when Ken Thompson, an early computer pioneer and one of the key developers of UNIX implemented regular expressions inside an early UNIX text editor that he was building called ed. This is the point at which regular expressions entered the computer world, and it happens right there at the birth of UNIX. So the future of regular expressions and UNIX is very much tied together.
			Now if you were a user of this text editor, ed, and you wanted to search the text for a regular expression, you would do it by typing a g and then a forward slash, and then the set of symbols that made up through regular expression for what you wanted to search for, and then at the end, another forward slash and a p. The g and the p were modifiers. The g was telling you to globally search for this expression, search everywhere, and p was to output the results to the screen, to print them. So we end up with a global regular expression print, or for short, grep. It becomes a verb.
			In the UNIX world, you're able to say, I want to grep something and it means that you want to search it for a regular expression. grep became so popular that it actually became a stand-alone program so that you could grep things in the UNIX file system as well, and it became widely used in other UNIX programs. So it really kind of spreads its way throughout the UNIX ecosystem. Now in my course UNIX for Mac OS X Users, I describe in some detail how UNIX became very popular during the 1970s. The short version of that story is it was high quality software that was free.
			Furthermore, these two factors made it very attractive to universities, and these universities then taught the next generation of computer stars using UNIX. So it helped to spread not only UNIX, but regular expressions as well. Now throughout the 1970s, UNIX spreads in popularity and it begins to evolve. At the same time, grep begins to evolve as well. Now there's a problem with evolving the regular expression language. We have a set of symbols that clearly define something that matches and doesn't match.
			Well, if you start changing the syntax of those symbols, then we create issues of backwards compatibility. Imagine if you had a basic character that didn't have a special meaning in one version, but then in a future version suddenly now that character has some special meaning. Well, all those old regular expressions would break; they would no longer match or the old engines would no longer be able to process the new regular expressions. In addition to grep, one of the early changes is to introduce a new program called egrep or extended grep. You can actually get the same behavior of egrep inside grep by using the E option after grep.</p>
