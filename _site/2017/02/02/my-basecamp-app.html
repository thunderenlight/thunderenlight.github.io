<h1 id="why-am-i-like-an-awesome-app">Why am I like an awesome App!</h1>

<p>Although the definition of application means both the request to an authority for something (e.g. a cover letter) and the action of putting something into operation, I have come to believe it also describes the best attributes that you want in a programmer and developer.  Basecamp provides a rooting and solidifying force.  Often when we think of OOP or FP in web architecture, there are characteristics that are more desirable.  As a programmer is my program, and the tools I use to apply a reflection of my solution space?  If so then it follows that it works both ways and I often like to think of these qualities of my work can also be used as a self portrait in programming.  Here are some of the broader character traits or lookalike features.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m obsessed with Basecamp web technologies and its open sourced tools.  With a passionate concentration on software engineering because it is developing new ways to empower those on the other side of the digital divide. Reaching beyond my comfort zone, I have come to love learning code mostly through the idea and implementation of open source and constant data feedback. Approaching the engineering community has given me opportunities to learn with peers from different backgrounds,  from instructors that lead with their heart and this has been the greatest motivation and structure for growth.</p>

<h1 id="responsiveness--user-friendly--interoperability">responsiveness | user friendly | interoperability</h1>

<h2 id="i-play-well-with-others">I play well with others.</h2>
<p>Communicating, interfacing, and considerations are key for interoperability. Empathy and user first philosophy improves trust, customer satisfaction, performance, and much more opportunity for growth and community.</p>

<h1 id="testability--acessibility--transparency">testability | acessibility | transparency</h1>

<h2 id="personal-growth-sets-based-on-short-feedback-loops-transparency-in-vulnerabilities-and-best-practices-in-tested-sessions-and-expressions">Personal growth sets based on short feedback loops. Transparency in vulnerabilities and best practices in tested sessions and expressions.</h2>

<h1 id="scalability--reliability">scalability | reliability</h1>

<p>While reliability is the ability of a system to continue operating in an expected way over time, and scalability is its ability to perform or expand under increasing load, I feel my ability to deliver under various stressors and remain collected is illustrated here.</p>

<h1 id="how-i-do-stack-up">How I do stack up</h1>

<p>After evaluation you will find my toolset, whether software or soft skills full and environment rich.
As a relatively young programmer easily tweak able and optimized for build and learning. With a growth mind set can be said my configuration is easily scriptable and new skills deployed.
Principled and passionate I will be an awesome app, especially with a footing in an environment that is BaseCamp. Basecamp isformative and foundational software, chisels, and organizes organizations? I love how it leverages, unifies tasks and team members alike. I would like to be apart of this lean green truth making machine!</p>
